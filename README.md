# Apache-Hadoop

Hadoop 3.2.1 Multi Node Cluster, Ubuntu 20.04

What is Hadoop?

“open-source software for reliable, scalable, distributed computing”, this means that is a framework for distributed processing.

What do you need to start the set-up?

I will use Ubuntu Server 20.04. The recommended space on your computer would be 24GB.
